Introduction
------------

This document describes the software requirements for the Spawn of EnergyPlus (SOEP) software
and its implementation.
The requirements pertain to the software implementation and mathematical capabilities.
Not described are the required physical and control models of the individual modules, as these are orthogonal to the here discussed requirements.

The document is a working document that is used as a discussion basis
and will evolve as the development progresses.
